# Testing Interactive Mode with Arrow Keys

This document describes how to test the new arrow key functionality in Shellux interactive mode.

## Features Added

1. **Command History Navigation**
   - Use ↑ (Up Arrow) to navigate to previous commands
   - Use ↓ (Down Arrow) to navigate to next commands
   - Command history persists between sessions

2. **Cursor Navigation**
   - Use ← (Left Arrow) to move cursor left
   - Use → (Right Arrow) to move cursor right
   - Ctrl+A to move to beginning of line
   - Ctrl+E to move to end of line

3. **Other Shortcuts**
   - Ctrl+C to interrupt current input (continue session)
   - Ctrl+D to exit (EOF)
   - Ctrl+L to clear screen

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Interactive Mode**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- -i
   ```

2. **Test Basic Commands**
   Enter these commands one by one:
   ```
   help
   echo "hello world"
   let x = 42
   echo "test command"
   ```

3. **Test Arrow Key Navigation**
   - Press ↑ to see "echo "test command""
   - Press ↑ again to see "let x = 42"
   - Press ↓ to go back to "echo "test command""
   - Press Enter to execute

4. **Test Cursor Movement**
   - Type: `echo "hello world"`
   - Press ← multiple times to move cursor to the middle
   - Type something to insert text at cursor position
   - Press Ctrl+A to jump to beginning
   - Press Ctrl+E to jump to end

5. **Test History Persistence**
   - Exit with `exit` or Ctrl+D
   - Restart interactive mode: `cargo run -- -i`
   - Press ↑ to see previous session's commands

## History File

Command history is saved to:
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `~/.shellux_history`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.shellux_history`

## Expected Behavior

- Commands should be stored in history as you type them
- Arrow keys should navigate through command history smoothly
- Cursor should move left/right within the current line
- History should persist between sessions
- All standard readline shortcuts should work

## Notes

The interactive mode now uses the `rustyline` crate which provides:
- Readline-style line editing
- Command history with persistence
- Standard terminal shortcuts
- Cross-platform support

This replaces the basic `stdin().read_line()` implementation with full-featured terminal input handling.
