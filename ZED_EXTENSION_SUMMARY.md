# Zed Extension Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The Shellux Zed extension was showing "invalid extension.json" errors and not working properly. Here's what was done to fix it:

### 1. Root Cause Identified

**Problem:** Zed requires **`extension.toml`** (TOML format), not `extension.json` (JSON format).

The original extension only had `extension.json`, which is a legacy format that newer versions of Zed don't support.

### 2. Created Proper `extension.toml`

Created the correct manifest file with:

```toml
id = "shellux"
name = "Shellux"
version = "0.1.0"
schema_version = 1
authors = ["Shellux Project <https://github.com/yourusername/shellux>"]
description = "Syntax highlighting for Shellux scripting language"
repository = "https://github.com/yourusername/shellux"

[grammars.shellux]
repository = "https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash"
rev = "f8fb3274f72a4a770546e09a4c69c8e6ff1f7ce5"
```

### 3. Updated Language Configuration

Created `languages/shellux/config.toml`:

```toml
name = "Shellux"
grammar = "shellux"
path_suffixes = ["sx", "shx"]
line_comments = ["# "]
block_comment = ["/*", "*/"]
autoclose_before = ";:.,=}])>` \n\t"

[brackets]
"(" = ")"
"{" = "}"
"[" = "]"
"\"" = "\""
"'" = "'"
"`" = "`"
```

### 4. Installation Now Works

The extension now installs successfully:

```bash
cd shellux/shellux-syntax-zed
./install.sh
```

Output:
```
‚úÖ Extension installed successfully!
Installation location: /Users/alexisk/.config/zed/extensions/shellux
```

No more "invalid extension.json" errors!

## Important Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Extension is Partially Functional

While the extension now installs correctly, **full Shellux syntax highlighting is not yet available**.

**Why?**

Zed **requires tree-sitter grammars** and does not support TextMate grammars. The Shellux TextMate grammar we have (`shellux.json`) cannot be used in Zed.

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Working:**
- File recognition for `.sx` and `.shx` files
- Basic syntax highlighting (using Bash grammar as fallback)
- Comment toggling (`Cmd+/` or `Ctrl+/`)
- Auto-closing brackets, braces, quotes
- Bracket matching

üü° **Partially Working:**
- Syntax highlighting is generic (Bash-like), not Shellux-specific
- Many Shellux keywords not highlighted correctly:
  - `is` keyword for assignment
  - `fn` for functions
  - Pipeline operator `|>`
  - Type annotations
  - Match expressions
  - Shellux-specific built-ins

‚ùå **Not Working:**
- Full Shellux-specific syntax highlighting
- Code outline/structure
- Syntax-aware folding
- Advanced editor features

## What's Needed for Full Support

### Create a Tree-sitter Grammar for Shellux

This is the **only blocker** for full functionality. We need:

1. **A `tree-sitter-shellux` repository** containing:
   - `grammar.js` - Defines Shellux syntax rules
   - Generated C parser code
   - Tree-sitter queries for highlighting
   - Test suite

2. **Update the extension** to use the new grammar:
   ```toml
   [grammars.shellux]
   repository = "https://github.com/yourusername/tree-sitter-shellux"
   rev = "main"
   ```

3. **Create comprehensive Tree-sitter queries**:
   - `highlights.scm` - Syntax highlighting rules
   - `indents.scm` - Auto-indentation
   - `injections.scm` - Embedded languages
   - `textobjects.scm` - Text objects for Vim mode

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 weeks for a working grammar

## Testing the Extension

### Install

```bash
cd shellux/shellux-syntax-zed
./install.sh
```

### Create Test File

```bash
cat > /tmp/test.shx << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env shellux

name is "World"
count := 42

fn greet(person: string) -> string {
    return "Hello, " + person
}

if count > 10 {
    print("Many")
}

files is $(ls -la)
EOF
```

### Open in Zed

```bash
zed /tmp/test.shx
```

### What You'll See

- ‚úÖ File recognized as "Shellux"
- ‚úÖ Basic syntax highlighting
- ‚úÖ Comments and strings colored
- ‚úÖ Some keywords highlighted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not all Shellux-specific syntax highlighted correctly

This is expected behavior with the current temporary Bash grammar fallback.

## Next Steps

### For Users

1. **Install the extension** - Basic highlighting is better than none
2. **Wait for tree-sitter grammar** - Full support coming once grammar is created
3. **Report issues** - Help us understand what's not working

### For Contributors

1. **Create the tree-sitter grammar** - This is the #1 priority
   - See `TREE_SITTER_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions
   - Start with basic features (variables, functions)
   - Test frequently
   - Share progress early

2. **Improve documentation** - Always room for improvement

3. **Test the extension** - Report bugs and edge cases

## Summary

### What Was Achieved

‚úÖ **Fixed the "invalid extension.json" error**
- Created proper `extension.toml` file
- Updated configuration files to TOML format
- Extension now installs without errors

‚úÖ **Provided basic functionality**
- File recognition works
- Basic syntax highlighting (using Bash grammar)
- Essential editor features (brackets, comments)

‚úÖ **Created comprehensive documentation**
- User guides and troubleshooting
- Developer guide for creating tree-sitter grammar
- Status and roadmap documentation

### What's Still Needed

üîú **Create tree-sitter grammar for Shellux**
- This is the only remaining blocker
- Estimated 1-2 weeks of focused work
- Complete guide provided in `TREE_SITTER_GUIDE.md`

### Current State

The extension is **functional for basic use** but requires a tree-sitter grammar for full Shellux-specific syntax highlighting. All infrastructure is in place and ready to use the proper grammar once it's created.

---

**Key Takeaway:** The extension installation is fixed and working. The path to full functionality is clear: create a tree-sitter grammar following the comprehensive guide provided.
