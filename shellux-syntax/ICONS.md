# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain icon files for the extension:

- `icon.png` - Main extension icon (128x128px recommended)
- `shellux-icon.svg` - Language icon for the file type

You can create custom icons for the Shellux language to make it more visually distinctive in the VS Code interface.

## Recommendations

- Use a distinctive color scheme (e.g., terminal green, shell blue)
- Include a recognizable symbol (e.g., a shell, terminal prompt, or "SX" monogram)
- Ensure good visibility in both light and dark themes
- Follow VS Code icon design guidelines

For now, the extension will work without icons, but adding them will improve the user experience.
